DOM manipulation is entirely with vanilla JavaScript. Owing to time constraints, there is minimal additional styling beyond what was supplied, but I do intend to build and style the markup from scratch in a version 2.0, utilizing CSS Grid along with flexbox. Additionaly, I intend to offer multiple difficulty levels by way of varying the number of milliseconds unmatched cards are visible.
